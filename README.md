# Vitamin_Tracker
Creates a GitHub-like graph that visually expresses the degree of consistency of habit via Pixela API calls.

I LOVE the Github graph so I was very excited to do this project! I am very familiar with doing get requests, but this project gave me practice with post, put, and delete requests along with using headers which was a very nice introduction. This project was simple and fun, thanks to how helpful Pixela's API documentation is!
